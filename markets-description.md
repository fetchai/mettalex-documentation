### **COMMODITIES** 

#### **COPPER**

Copper is widely used around the world due to its industrial and technological applications. Its physical properties, which are similar to gold and silver, make it perfectly suited for a range of industrial uses \(e.g. electric wiring, plumbing, roofing, and industrial machinery\). However, unlike gold and silver, copper is not widely viewed as a store of value. Therefore, copper is less impacted by speculative price movements. The global supply of copper comes principally from underground mines and from recycling copper products. As developing regions in the African continent, Eastern Europe and Asia modernise their economies and expand their infrastructure, the higher will be the demand for copper from these areas of the world.

* A long position could represents the view that demand for infrastructure, industry and housing may rise as emerging markets grow in the future;
* Going short could mean the events of 2020 may have unexpected effects on copper demand, since the global economic and infrastructural expansion may suffer further.

1. **IRON ORE**

**Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world’s iron is used to produce steel. However, iron is never found by itself in nature. In fact, most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements. Iron oxide is the most common of these minerals.**

**Today’s worldwide production is more than 2.2 billion metric tons of usable iron ore, which contains about 1.4 billion metric tons of iron. With steel being a critical material in buildings, infrastructure, mechanical equipment, and automobiles, iron ore is an important global commodity.** 

* **A long position could mean you think the heavy production industry will expand in the future;**
* **Conversely, going short might mean you believe  the production will be dominated by low carbon methods.**

1. **STEEL SCRAP**

**Steel scrap is a vital raw material for the production of new steel. The steel industry has been recycling steel scrap for decades, as steel making and foundry industries are highly dependent upon the ready availability of scrap from manufacturing operations and from the recovery of products that are no longer used or needed. Because of this, the use of steel scrap implies a lower impact on the environment when compared to heavy production methods \(e.g. IRON ORE\).** 

**Steel scrap recycling conserves raw materials, energy, and landfill space.  The domestic steel industry recycles millions of metric tons per year of steel cans, automobiles, appliances, construction materials, and other steel products.  The primary source of obsolete steel is the automobile.  The remelting of scrap requires much less energy than the production of iron and steel products from iron ore.  Consumption of iron and steel scrap by remelting reduces the burden on landfill disposal facilities and prevents the accumulation of abandoned steel products in the environment.**

* **If you go long that could means you think its demand for steel production will increase, thus lowering the environmental impact compared to the primary steel production from refined ores and mining products;**
* **A short position might mean you think its demand will decrease while the demand for refined ores and mining products will increase thus also increasing the environmental impact.**

1. **STEEL SCRAP SHREDDED**

**Shredded scrap is a large part of the recycling industry and can be utilised in multiple circumstances. It consists of homogeneous iron and steel scrap, which is magnetically separated, originating from automobiles,  miscellaneous baling and sheet scrap.  Shredded scrap’s average density ranges from 50 to 70 pounds per cubic foot.**

* **If you go long it could mean you believe steel scrap demand will rise following a higher infrastructure demand, as this material can be introduced for the production of steel, but with a lower environmental impact when compared to the primary production of steel from ores and refined mining products;**
* **Go short if you think that its demand will face a decrease due to the effects of the global pandemic on the industry and infrastructure sector.**

1. **ZORBA 95/2**

**It is the term used for shredded and pre-treated non-ferrous scrap metals, commonly obtained from End-of-Life Vehicles \(i.e. ELVs\) or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment \(i.e. WEEE\).** 

**Other non-ferrous metals found in Zorba include copper, lead, brass, magnesium, nickel, tin and zinc in elemental or alloyed form. Stainless steel is usually only present in small quantities, depending on the grade of material.**

* **A long exposure could mean you think consumer and industrial demand for zorba will increase as an effect of higher demand for consumables after the pandemic;**
* **A short position thus could mean you think zorba demand will shrink due to lower demand and shortcomings in industrial sorting methods.**

1. **HMS 1&2 \(80:20\) CFR Turkey**

**Heavy Melting Steel \(HMS\) or Heavy Melting Scrap is a designation for recyclable steel and wrought iron. It is broken up into two major categories: HMS 1 and HMS 2, where HMS 1 does not contain galvanized and blackened steel, whereas HMS 2 does.**

* **Going long might mean you think demand for heavy melting scrap will increase as a consequence of economic recovery as industry expands and production grows;**
* **On the other hand, going short could mean you think the global recession will continue to impact the industry thus reducing its demand and prices.**

1. **BRENT CRUDE OIL**

**Brent Oil is also known as Brent Crude or North Sea Brent Crude and it is a type of crude oil which is considered as a benchmark crude for determining the trading price of other varieties of crude oil.** 

**Where the oil comes from also makes a difference if you’re a buyer. The less expensive it is to deliver the product, the cheaper it is for the consumer. From a transportation point of view, oil extracted at sea has certain advantages over land-based supplies, which depend on the capacity of pipelines. Brent Crude oil  is light and sweet, making them ideal for the refining of diesel fuel, gasoline, and other high-demand products. And because the supply is waterborne, it’s easy to transport to distant locations.**

* **A long position could represent the fact you think crude oil prices will increase in the future due to economic expansion following the pandemic;**
* **On the other hand, going short could mean you believe the effects of the pandemic will last longer thus shrinking the demand for crude oil and its prices.**

1. **ZINC**

**Zinc resists corrosion and is used to galvanise iron and steel for industrial and infrastructure purposes. Zinc is also used to produce brass \(i.e. a zinc alloy that contains between 55 and 95% copper\) widely used in construction and in the production of tools and products. Mines worldwide are spread all over the Planet and these extract more almost 12  million metric tons of zinc per annum.** 

* **If you decide to go long you could gain if zinc production increases as an effect of higher demand for industrial purposes;**
* **Conversely, if you decide to open a short position you will make a profit only if the demand for zinc shrinks due to the global recession.**

1. **BUTTER**

**Butter is a typically yellow or white dairy product consisting of an emulsion of butterfat and made by churning milk or cream.**  


* **Going long could mean you think demand for butter will increase following the economic recovery;**
* **Conversely, going short could mean you think the opposite trend in demand will shrink butter prices.**

1. **GOLD**

**Since the beginning of civilization, humankind has viewed gold as a proxy for money and a safe-haven asset. Once it is mined, refiners process gold into bars, coins, or ingots called bullion in order to sell them. Buyers can transform these gold bars into items like coins, jewelry, and electronic components. They may also store gold bars for traders.**

**Gold supply is consistently affected by the price of gold itself: when gold prices arise, mining gold becomes more profitable, so more supply comes into the market. The opposite happens when prices decline. Similarly, changes in demand from industry, traders, central banks, or sovereign wealth funds can move gold prices. In fact, Central Banks could impact on gold prices in two ways:**

* **These could take decisions to contract or grow the money supply in their countries, thus leading to an increase in gold trading since fiat currencies \(eg, US dollar and euro\) compete with gold as a store of value and a form of money.** 
* **Secondly, central banks hold large gold reserves. As a result, their decision to accumulate or sell reserves can move the gold market.**
* **A long exposure could mean you think gold demand will increase thanks to increased interest from industries and traders, also internationally, as fast-growing Asian economies, like India and China, have increased their demand for gold in recent years, therefore it can increase in the future due to the economic recovery.**
* **A short position, could conversely mean you think the desire to hoard this metal as a safe-haven and store of value purposes is likely to decrease following the effects of the pandemic on the global economy.**

1. **SILVER**

**Silver is one of the most valuable metals on the planet due to its widespread utility in jewellery and its industrial applications in silverware and electronics. Even though it is not as scarce as gold, it represents a precious metal widely used in the financial industry for investments. This makes silver a commodity of high interest for a variety of market participants who actively trade silver futures for hedging or price protection.** 

**Silver is a very volatile commodity. The increase in the industrial demand is the primary factor for increased volatility in silver prices.  At the moment the industrial demand consists of over half of the total worldwide demand.** 

* **Going long could mean you believe many situations could increase the demand for silver and lead to higher prices. An expansion of the electronics and automobile industry would lead to a higher demand for silver. Increasing oil prices could also increase the demand for silver by forcing the use of alternative energy, such as solar. In fact, the latter implements silver in its equipment;**
* **On the other hand, going short could represent the fact you think a recession or slowdown in industrial demand would lower silver prices.**
