# Markets description

## **MARKETS**

The markets available on Mettalex Vega are divided into the following 3 categories:

### **1.  COMMODITIES** 

#### **COPPER**

Copper is widely used around the world due to its industrial and technological applications. Its physical properties, which are similar to gold and silver, make it perfectly suited for a range of industrial uses \(e.g. electric wiring, plumbing, roofing, and industrial machinery\). However, unlike gold and silver, copper is not widely viewed as a store of value. Therefore, copper is less impacted by speculative price movements. The global supply of copper comes principally from underground mines and from recycling copper products. As developing regions in the African continent, Eastern Europe and Asia modernise their economies and expand their infrastructure, the higher will be the demand for copper from these areas of the world.

**How to trade?**\*

* Buy the CULONG token if you believe that demand for copper will increase and its price will go up as a consequence of a global industrial recovery;
* Buy the CUSHORT token if you think demand for copper will shrink due to a lack of major new infrastructure projects development.

**Settlement**

You can sell your CULONG or CUSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold CULONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the CULONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold CUSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the CUSHORT tokens.

#### **IRON ORE**

Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world’s iron is used to produce steel. However, iron is never found by itself in nature. In fact, most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements. Iron oxide is the most common of these minerals.

Today’s worldwide production is more than 2.2 billion metric tons of usable iron ore, which contains about 1.4 billion metric tons of iron. With steel being a critical material in buildings, infrastructure, mechanical equipment, and automobiles, iron ore is an important global commodity. 

**How to trade?**\*

* Buy the IOLONG token if you believe that the heavy production industry will expand in the future as consequence of the industrial recovery after the pandemic;
* Buy the IOSHORT token if you believe that steel use in the production of structures, ships, automobiles, and machinery will decline in the future.

#### **STEEL SCRAP**

Steel scrap is a vital raw material for the production of new steel. The steel industry has been recycling steel scrap for decades, as steel making and foundry industries are highly dependent upon the ready availability of scrap from manufacturing operations and from the recovery of products that are no longer used or needed. Because of this, the use of steel scrap implies a lower impact on the environment when compared to heavy production methods \(e.g. IRON ORE\). 

Steel scrap recycling conserves raw materials, energy, and landfill space.  The domestic steel industry recycles millions of metric tons per year of steel cans, automobiles, appliances, construction materials, and other steel products.  The primary source of obsolete steel is the automobile.  The remelting of scrap requires much less energy than the production of iron and steel products from iron ore.  Consumption of iron and steel scrap by remelting reduces the burden on landfill disposal facilities and prevents the accumulation of abandoned steel products in the environment.

**How to trade?**\*

* Buy the SSCLONG token if you believe that demand for steel scrap will increase, due to environmental considerations by companies and governments.
* Instead, buy the SSCSHORT token if you believe its demand will decrease while the demand for refined ores and mining products will increase so the environmental impact.

**STEEL SCRAP SHREDDED**

Shredded scrap is a large part of the recycling industry and can be utilised in multiple circumstances. It consists of homogeneous iron and steel scrap, which is magnetically separated, originating from automobiles,  miscellaneous baling and sheet scrap.  Shredded scrap’s average density ranges from 50 to 70 pounds per cubic foot.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the DSSHLONG token if you believe steel scrap demand will rise following a higher infrastructure demand, as this material can be introduced for the production of steel, but with a lower environmental impact when compared to its primary production from ores and refined mining products;
* Buy the DSSHSHORT token if you believe steel scrap demand will face challenges due to the effects of the pandemic on global industry and infrastructure development.

#### **ZORBA 95/2**

It is the term used for shredded and pre-treated non-ferrous scrap metals, commonly obtained from End-of-Life Vehicles \(i.e. ELVs\) or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment \(i.e. WEEE\). 

Other non-ferrous metals found in Zorba include copper, lead, brass, magnesium, nickel, tin and zinc in elemental or alloyed form. Stainless steel is usually only present in small quantities, depending on the grade of material.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the DZRBLONG token if you believe consumer and industrial demand for Zorba will increase as an effect of higher demand for consumables after the pandemic.
* Buy the DZRBSHORT token if you think Zorba consumption will shrink due to lower demand and shortcomings in industrial sorting methods.

#### **BRENT CRUDE OIL**

Brent Oil is also known as Brent Crude or North Sea Brent Crude and it is a type of crude oil which is considered as a benchmark crude for determining the trading price of other varieties of crude oil. 

Where the oil comes from also makes a difference if you’re a buyer. The less expensive it is to deliver the product, the cheaper it is for the consumer. From a transportation point of view, oil extracted at sea has certain advantages over land-based supplies, which depend on the capacity of pipelines. Brent Crude oil  is light and sweet, making them ideal for the refining of diesel fuel, gasoline, and other high-demand products. And because the supply is waterborne, it’s easy to transport to distant locations.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the BBLONG token if you believe demand for crude oil will increase in the future due to the economic expansion following the pandemic;
* Buy the BBSHORT token if you think the effects of the pandemic will last longer than expected, shrinking demand for Brent Crude and lowering its price.

#### **GOLD**

Since the beginning of civilization, humankind has viewed gold as a proxy for money and a safe-haven asset. Once it is mined, refiners process gold into bars, coins, or ingots called bullion in order to sell them. Buyers can transform these gold bars into items like coins, jewelry, and electronic components. They may also store gold bars for traders.

Gold supply is consistently affected by the price of gold itself: when gold prices arise, mining gold becomes more profitable, so more supply comes into the market. The opposite happens when prices decline. Similarly, changes in demand from industry, traders, central banks, or sovereign wealth funds can move gold prices. In fact, Central Banks could impact on gold prices in two ways:

* These could take decisions to contract or grow the money supply in their countries, thus leading to an increase in gold trading since fiat currencies \(eg, US dollar and euro\) compete with gold as a store of value and a form of money. 
* Secondly, central banks hold large gold reserves. As a result, their decision to accumulate or sell reserves can move the gold market.

How to trade?\*

* Buy the XAULONG token if you believe gold demand will increase due to interest from traders seeking refuge from devaluing fiat currencies;
* Buy the XAUSHORT token if you believe the large stimulus packages approved by governments will push investors towards the acquisition of higher-risk assets and gold will go out of fashion.

#### **SILVER**

Silver is one of the most valuable metals on the planet due to its widespread utility in jewellery and its industrial applications in silverware and electronics. Even though it is not as scarce as gold, it represents a precious metal widely used in the financial industry for investments. This makes silver a commodity of high interest for a variety of market participants who actively trade silver futures for hedging or price protection. 

Silver is a very volatile commodity. The increase in the industrial demand is the primary factor for increased volatility in silver prices.  At the moment the industrial demand consists of over half of the total worldwide demand.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the XAGLONG token if you think demand for silver in industrial applications and as a safe-haven asset will increase leading to higher prices.
* Buy the XAGSHORT token if you believe a recession or slowdown in industrial demand would lower silver prices.

The crypto asset shares some of gold’s unique properties, while addressing a number of its shortcomings. The BTC/XAU market on Mettalex is a great place to take a formal position in the physical gold or digital gold debate.

**How to trade?**

* Buy  the BTCXAUL token if you believe a borderless, unfalsifiable, digitally scarce, crypto asset will be a safer hedge against inflation in comparison to gold;
* Buy the BTCXAUS token if you think gold has already proven its lack of correlation with equities and will perform better than bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.

#### **BTC/TSLA**

The richest man on Earth - Elon Musk - recently announced a $1.5b position open by his company Tesla. So far the decision to buy into bitcoin has proven wise, with Tesla’s profits in 2020 likely being lower than the USD-denominated unrealized profits of its bitcoin position in 2021. Although Tesla’s bitcoin position represents only about 8% of the company portfolio, the electric vehicles manufacturer and the original cryptocurrency are now related.   


Use the unique BTC/TSLA spread on Mettalex to express your views on the price movements of BTC and TSLA against each other. 

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the BTCTSLAL token if you believe bitcoin’s price will perform better than Tesla stock in the future; 
* Buy the BCTSLAS token if you believe Tesla is undervalued against BTC and its price will increase in the future.

#### **AAVE/COMP**

Aave is a decentralized money market protocol that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a trustless manner. Compound is providing a similar service but is more conservative in terms of the crypto assets that could be lended or borrowed. Users of both protocols can lend cryptocurrencies to receive an annual percentage yield or borrow assets for increased exposure to crypto markets or to spend for goods or services in the real world.  


Use the AAVE/COMP spread to get exposure to price movements of the two assets against each other.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the AAVECOMPL token if you own COMP tokens but you think there is a chance that AAVE will become the dominant lending protocol in the DeFi space;
* Buy the AAVECOMPS if you hold AAVE tokens but believe that Compound will continue to acquire market share in the DeFi lending space and its token will appreciate faster than AAVE.

#### **LINK/BAND**

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to most of the projects in the DeFi space. The LINK token is used in the Chainlink network to compensate Chainlink Node operators for the retrieval of data from the external data sources, turning it to blockchain readable format, off-chain computation, and uptime guarantees.

BAND is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. Band allows blockchains to access data, such as stock prices and weather, that are available via API providing a similar service to that of Chainlink. The BAND token is used for staking by node operators as a guarantee for the quality of the real-world data provided. In addition, BAND is used for payment of fees for transactions performed on the BAND network.

Use the LINK/BAND market on Mettalex to hedge your exposure of owning either of the two tokens or speculate on price movements of the two tokens against each other.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the LINKBANDL token if you believe Chainlink will continue to grow its market share and its price will perform better than that of its primary competitor;
* Buy the LINKBANDS token if you think BAND will oust Chainlink by acquiring a larger share of the market, and its token will appreciate against LINK.

Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, created in January 2009. It is the most popular decentralized currency and the largest one by market capitalization. Unlike fiat currency, bitcoin is created, distributed, and stored in a decentralized ledger, known as a blockchain. It is limited to 21,000,000 units and its inflation rate is fully predictable.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy a BTCLONG token if you believe that its demand will tend to grow as a result of increased popularity assumed as a means of payment;
* Buy the BTCSHORT token if you believe Bitcoin demand and price will decrease in the future.

**Settlement**

You can sell your BTC tokens to Mettalex's Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap of the band, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold BTCLONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the BTCLONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold BTCSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the BTCSHORT tokens.

**ETHEREUM** 

Ether is the world’s second-largest virtual currency by market capitalization. It is the transactional token that facilitates operations on the Ethereum network. The initiation of transactions and execution of smart contracts on Ethereum require computing power provided by Ethereum nodes. For their computational work, nodes are compensated in ether. As such, ether is considered as the unit of account for all operations performed by the Ethereum and could be perceived as the network’s fuel.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the ETHLONG token if you believe that demand for ether will grow as it becomes more scarce due to locking or burning of ETH and thanks to the expansion of Ethereum’s ecosystem of decentralized applications;
* Buy the ETHSHORT token if you think more advanced smart contract platforms will manage to attract the bulk of liquidity due to improved scalability.

**LINK**

Chainlink is a tokenized oracle network that provides price and events data originating from on-chain and real-world sources. Chainlink was launched in 2017 and it aims to offer a solution to the oracle problem, that is, the ability to acquire off-chain data in a decentralized and secure way and deliver it to blockchain-based applications. Chainlink oracle feeds are widely used in Ethereum’s growing DeFi ecosystem. The purpose of the LINK token is to incentivise the use of the protocol.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the LINKLONG token if you think LINK’s price will increase as an effect of growing usage of Chainlink’s data feeds in the blockchain space;
* Buy the LINKSHORT token if you believe Chainlink’s competitors will manage to overcome its network effect and become the more relevant smart contract data providers.
