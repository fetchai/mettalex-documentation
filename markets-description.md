# Markets description

## **MARKETS**

The markets available on Mettalex DEX are divided into the following 3 categories:

### **1.  COMMODITIES**

****

#### **ALUMINIUM**

Aluminium is a very flexible, light-weight, and strong metal which can be counted to the base metals or non-ferrous metals. As a physical commodity, aluminium is traded as raw material, unfinished, semi-finished or finished product and as scrap metal**.** Aluminium is obtained from grinding raw material bauxite to extract and refine the contained aluminium oxide (i.e. alumina) which is further processed into liquid aluminium (i.e. molten aluminium) by adding carbon and electricity. The molten aluminium is casted into different shapes and can be further rolled, extruded or re-melted. Aluminium can be used for the following 3 applications:

* Castings
* Extrusions
* Production of hot/cold rolled products

Casting products include logs, billets (extrusion ingots), slabs for rolling , high purity ingots, T-ingots (T-bars), wire rods, and primary foundry alloys.  Commonly, castings are used in the automotive, aviation, buildings and construction, cable, electrical, and packaging industries. While castings can be also referred to as upstream aluminium products, extrusions and rolled aluminium applications are more downstream in the production line. Semi-finished extrusion products include bars, profiles, and tubes and they are produced for the automotive, building and construction, engineering, and transportation industry. Rolled aluminium products can be traded for instance as coils, foil, plates, shates, sheets, and strips. These are applications used in various industries including automotive, building and construction, engineering, food, marine, packaging, printing, and transportation.

Furthermore, aluminium can be easily recycled and traded as scrap metal. When recycling aluminium applications, they can be completely re-shaped into any product.

**How to trade?**\*

* Buy the ALLONG token if you believe that demand for aluminium will increase as a consequence of a higher demand from the industrial sector after the pandemic;
* Buy the ALSHORT token if you think demand for this material will shrink due to a lower demand for industrial applications  and infrastructures;

#### **BRENT CRUDE OIL**

Brent Oil is also known as Brent Crude or North Sea Brent Crude and it is a type of crude oil which is considered as a benchmark crude for determining the trading price of other varieties of crude oil. Where the oil comes from also makes a difference if you’re a buyer. The less expensive it is to deliver the product, the cheaper it is for the consumer. From a transportation point of view, oil extracted at sea has certain advantages over land-based supplies, which depend on the capacity of pipelines. Brent Crude oil  is light and sweet, making them ideal for the refining of diesel fuel, gasoline, and other high-demand products. And because the supply is waterborne, it’s easy to transport to distant locations.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the BBLONG token if you believe demand for crude oil will increase in the future due to the economic expansion following the pandemic;
* Buy the BBSHORT token if you think the effects of the pandemic will last longer than expected, shrinking demand for Brent Crude and lowering its price.

#### **COPPER**

Copper is widely used around the world due to its industrial and technological applications. Its physical properties, which are similar to gold and silver, make it perfectly suited for a range of industrial uses (e.g. electric wiring, plumbing, roofing, and industrial machinery). However, unlike gold and silver, copper is not widely viewed as a store of value. Therefore, copper is less impacted by speculative price movements. The global supply of copper comes principally from underground mines and from recycling copper products. As developing regions in the African continent, Eastern Europe and Asia modernise their economies and expand their infrastructure, the higher will be the demand for copper from these areas of the world.

**How to trade?**\*

* Buy the CULONG token if you believe that demand for copper will increase and its price will go up as a consequence of a global industrial recovery;
* Buy the CUSHORT token if you think demand for copper will shrink due to a lack of major new infrastructure projects development.

#### **GOLD**

Since the beginning of civilisation, humankind has viewed gold as a proxy for money and a safe-haven asset. Once it is mined, refiners process gold into bars, coins, or ingots called bullion in order to sell them. Buyers can transform these gold bars into items like coins, jewelry, and electronic components. They may also store gold bars for trade. Gold supply is consistently affected by the price of gold itself: when gold prices arise, mining gold becomes more profitable, so more supply comes into the market. The opposite happens when prices decline. Similarly, changes in demand from industry, traders, central banks, or sovereign wealth funds can move gold prices. In fact, Central Banks could impact on gold prices in two ways:

* These could take decisions to contract or grow the money supply in their countries, thus leading to an increase in gold trading since fiat currencies (eg, US dollar and euro) compete with gold as a store of value and a form of money.&#x20;
* Secondly, central banks hold large gold reserves. As a result, their decision to accumulate or sell reserves can move the gold market.

How to trade?\*

* Buy the XAULONG token if you believe gold demand will increase due to interest from traders seeking refuge from devaluing fiat currencies;
* Buy the XAUSHORT token if you believe the large stimulus packages approved by governments will push investors towards the acquisition of higher-risk assets and gold will go out of fashion.

#### **IRON ORE**

Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world’s iron is used to produce steel. However, iron is never found by itself in nature. In fact, most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements. Iron oxide is the most common of these minerals.

Today’s worldwide production is more than 2.2 billion metric tons of usable iron ore, which contains about 1.4 billion metric tons of iron. With steel being a critical material in buildings, infrastructure, mechanical equipment, and automobiles, iron ore is an important global commodity.&#x20;

**How to trade?**\*

* Buy the IOLONG token if you believe that the heavy production industry will expand in the future as consequence of the industrial recovery after the pandemic;
* Buy the IOSHORT token if you believe that steel use in the production of structures, ships, automobiles, and machinery will decline in the future.

**SILVER**

Silver is one of the most valuable metals on the planet due to its widespread utility in jewellery and its industrial applications in silverware and electronics. Even though it is not as scarce as gold, it represents a precious metal widely used in the financial industry for investments. This makes silver a commodity of high interest for a variety of market participants who actively trade silver futures for hedging or price protection.&#x20;

Silver is a very volatile commodity. The increase in the industrial demand is the primary factor for increased volatility in silver prices.  At the moment the industrial demand consists of over half of the total worldwide demand.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the XAGLONG token if you think demand for silver in industrial applications and as a safe-haven asset will increase leading to higher prices.
* Buy the XAGSHORT token if you believe a recession or slowdown in industrial demand would lower silver prices.

#### **STEEL SCRAP**

Steel scrap is a vital raw material for the production of new steel. The steel industry has been recycling steel scrap for decades, as steel making and foundry industries are highly dependent upon the ready availability of scrap from manufacturing operations and from the recovery of products that are no longer used or needed. Because of this, the use of steel scrap implies a lower impact on the environment when compared to heavy production methods (e.g. IRON ORE).&#x20;

Steel scrap recycling conserves raw materials, energy, and landfill space.  The domestic steel industry recycles millions of metric tons per year of steel cans, automobiles, appliances, construction materials, and other steel products.  The primary source of obsolete steel is the automobile.  The remelting of scrap requires much less energy than the production of iron and steel products from iron ore.  Consumption of iron and steel scrap by remelting reduces the burden on landfill disposal facilities and prevents the accumulation of abandoned steel products in the environment.

**How to trade?**\*

* Buy the SSCLONG token if you believe that demand for steel scrap will increase, due to environmental considerations by companies and governments.
* Instead, buy the SSCSHORT token if you believe its demand will decrease while the demand for refined ores and mining products will increase so the environmental impact.

**STEEL SCRAP SHREDDED**

Shredded scrap is a large part of the recycling industry and can be utilised in multiple circumstances. It consists of homogeneous iron and steel scrap, which is magnetically separated, originating from automobiles,  miscellaneous baling and sheet scrap.  Shredded scrap’s average density ranges from 50 to 70 pounds per cubic foot.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the DSSHLONG token if you believe steel scrap demand will rise following a higher infrastructure demand, as this material can be introduced for the production of steel, but with a lower environmental impact when compared to its primary production from ores and refined mining products;
* Buy the DSSHSHORT token if you believe steel scrap demand will face challenges due to the effects of the pandemic on global industry and infrastructure development.

#### **AAVE/COMP spread**

Aave is a decentralised money market protocol that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a trustless manner. Compound is providing a similar service but is more conservative in terms of the crypto assets that could be lent or borrowed. Users of both protocols can lend cryptocurrencies to receive an annual percentage yield or borrow assets for increased exposure to crypto markets or to spend for goods or services in the real world.

Use the AAVE/COMP spread to get exposure to price movements of the two assets against each other.

**How to trade?\***

* Buy the AAVECOMPL token if you own COMP tokens but you think there is a chance that AAVE will become the dominant lending protocol in the DeFi space;
* Buy the AAVECOMPS if you hold AAVE tokens but believe that Compound will continue to acquire market share in the DeFi lending space and its token will appreciate faster than AAVE.
