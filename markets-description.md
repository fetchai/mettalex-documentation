# Markets description

## **MARKETS**

The markets available on Mettalex Vega are divided into the following categories:

### **1.  COMMODITIES** 

#### **COPPER**

Copper is widely used around the world due to its industrial and technological applications. Its physical properties, which are similar to gold and silver, make it perfectly suited for a range of industrial uses \(e.g. electric wiring, plumbing, roofing, and industrial machinery\). However, unlike gold and silver, copper is not widely viewed as a store of value. Therefore, copper is less impacted by speculative price movements. The global supply of copper comes principally from underground mines and from recycling copper products. As developing regions in the African continent, Eastern Europe and Asia modernise their economies and expand their infrastructure, the higher will be the demand for copper from these areas of the world.

**How to trade?**

* Buy the CULONG token if you believe that demand for copper will increase and its price will go up as a consequence of the industrial recover
* Buy the CUSHORT token if you believe demand for copper and its price will shrink.

**Settlement**

You can sell your CULONG or CUSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold CULONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the CULONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold CUSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the CUSHORT tokens.

#### **IRON ORE**

Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world’s iron is used to produce steel. However, iron is never found by itself in nature. In fact, most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements. Iron oxide is the most common of these minerals.

Today’s worldwide production is more than 2.2 billion metric tons of usable iron ore, which contains about 1.4 billion metric tons of iron. With steel being a critical material in buildings, infrastructure, mechanical equipment, and automobiles, iron ore is an important global commodity. 

**How to trade?**

* Buy the IOLONG token if you believe that the heavy production industry will expand in the future as consequence of the industrial recovery after the pandemic;
* Instead, buy the IOSHORT token if you believe that production will be dominated by low-carbon methods, thereby reducing demand for iron ore due to its greater environmental impact, both at the time of mining and in its use in industry.

**Settlement**

You can sell your IOLONG or IOSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold IOLONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the IOLONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold IOSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the IOSHORT tokens.

\*\*\*\*

#### **STEEL SCRAP**

Steel scrap is a vital raw material for the production of new steel. The steel industry has been recycling steel scrap for decades, as steel making and foundry industries are highly dependent upon the ready availability of scrap from manufacturing operations and from the recovery of products that are no longer used or needed. Because of this, the use of steel scrap implies a lower impact on the environment when compared to heavy production methods \(e.g. IRON ORE\). 

Steel scrap recycling conserves raw materials, energy, and landfill space.  The domestic steel industry recycles millions of metric tons per year of steel cans, automobiles, appliances, construction materials, and other steel products.  The primary source of obsolete steel is the automobile.  The remelting of scrap requires much less energy than the production of iron and steel products from iron ore.  Consumption of iron and steel scrap by remelting reduces the burden on landfill disposal facilities and prevents the accumulation of abandoned steel products in the environment.

**How to trade?**

* Buy the SSCLONG token if you believe its demand for steel production will increase thus lowering the environmental impact compared to the primary steel production from refined ores and mining products;
* Instead, buy the SSCSHORT token if you believe its demand will decrease while the demand for refined ores and mining products will increase so the environmental impact.

**Settlement**

You can sell your SSCLONG or SSCSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold SSCLONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the SSCLONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold SSCSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the SSCSHORT tokens.

**STEEL SCRAP SHREDDED**

Shredded scrap is a large part of the recycling industry and can be utilised in multiple circumstances. It consists of homogeneous iron and steel scrap, which is magnetically separated, originating from automobiles,  miscellaneous baling and sheet scrap.  Shredded scrap’s average density ranges from 50 to 70 pounds per cubic foot.

**How to trade?**

* Buy the DSSHLONG token if you believe steel scrap demand will rise following a higher infrastructure demand, as this material can be introduced for the production of steel, but with a lower environmental impact when compared to the primary production of steel from ores and refined mining products;
* Instead, buy the DSSHSHORT token if you believe its demand will face a decrease due to the effects of the global pandemic on the industry and infrastructure sector.

**Settlement**

You can sell your SSCLONG or DSSHSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold DSSHLONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the DSSHLONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold DSSHSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the DSSHSHORT tokens.

#### **ZORBA 95/2**

It is the term used for shredded and pre-treated non-ferrous scrap metals, commonly obtained from End-of-Life Vehicles \(i.e. ELVs\) or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment \(i.e. WEEE\). 

Other non-ferrous metals found in Zorba include copper, lead, brass, magnesium, nickel, tin and zinc in elemental or alloyed form. Stainless steel is usually only present in small quantities, depending on the grade of material.

**How to trade?**

* Buy the DZRBLONG token if you believe consumer and industrial demand for zorba will increase as an effect of higher demand for consumables after the pandemic;
* Instead, buy the DZRBSHORT token if you believe zorba demand will shrink due to lower demand and shortcomings in industrial sorting methods.

**Settlement**

You can sell your DZRBLONG or DZRBSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold DZRBLONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the DZRBLONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold DZRBSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the DZRBSHORT tokens.

#### **BRENT CRUDE OIL**

Brent Oil is also known as Brent Crude or North Sea Brent Crude and it is a type of crude oil which is considered as a benchmark crude for determining the trading price of other varieties of crude oil. 

Where the oil comes from also makes a difference if you’re a buyer. The less expensive it is to deliver the product, the cheaper it is for the consumer. From a transportation point of view, oil extracted at sea has certain advantages over land-based supplies, which depend on the capacity of pipelines. Brent Crude oil  is light and sweet, making them ideal for the refining of diesel fuel, gasoline, and other high-demand products. And because the supply is waterborne, it’s easy to transport to distant locations.

**How to trade?**

* Buy the BBLONG token if you believe demand for crude oil will increase in the future due to economic expansion following the pandemic;
* Instead, buy the BBSHORT token if you believe  the effects of the pandemic will last longer thus shrinking the demand for crude oil and its prices.

**Settlement**

You can sell your BBLONG or BBSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold BBLONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the BBLONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold BBSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the BBSHORT tokens.

#### **GOLD**

Since the beginning of civilization, humankind has viewed gold as a proxy for money and a safe-haven asset. Once it is mined, refiners process gold into bars, coins, or ingots called bullion in order to sell them. Buyers can transform these gold bars into items like coins, jewelry, and electronic components. They may also store gold bars for traders.

Gold supply is consistently affected by the price of gold itself: when gold prices arise, mining gold becomes more profitable, so more supply comes into the market. The opposite happens when prices decline. Similarly, changes in demand from industry, traders, central banks, or sovereign wealth funds can move gold prices. In fact, Central Banks could impact on gold prices in two ways:

* These could take decisions to contract or grow the money supply in their countries, thus leading to an increase in gold trading since fiat currencies \(eg, US dollar and euro\) compete with gold as a store of value and a form of money. 
* Secondly, central banks hold large gold reserves. As a result, their decision to accumulate or sell reserves can move the gold market.

**How to trade?**

* Buy the XAULONG token if you believe gold demand will increase thanks to increased interest from industries and traders, also internationally, as fast-growing Asian economies, like India and China, have increased their demand for gold in recent years, therefore it can increase in the future due to the economic recovery;
* Buy the XAUSHORT token if you believe the desire to hoard this metal as a safe-haven and store of value purposes is likely to decrease following the effects of the pandemic on the global economy.

**Settlement**

You can sell your XAULONG or XAUSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold XAULONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the XAULONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold XAUSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the XAUSHORT tokens.

#### **SILVER**

Silver is one of the most valuable metals on the planet due to its widespread utility in jewellery and its industrial applications in silverware and electronics. Even though it is not as scarce as gold, it represents a precious metal widely used in the financial industry for investments. This makes silver a commodity of high interest for a variety of market participants who actively trade silver futures for hedging or price protection. 

Silver is a very volatile commodity. The increase in the industrial demand is the primary factor for increased volatility in silver prices.  At the moment the industrial demand consists of over half of the total worldwide demand.

**How to trade?**

* Buy the XAGLONG token if you believe many situations could increase the demand for silver and lead to higher prices. An expansion of the electronics and automobile industry would lead to a higher demand for silver. Increasing oil prices could also increase the demand for silver by forcing the use of alternative energy, such as solar. In fact, the latter implements silver in its equipment;
* Buy the XAGSHORT token if you believe a recession or slowdown in industrial demand would lower silver prices.

**Settlement**

You can sell your XAGLONG or XAGSHORT tokens to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold XAGLONG tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the XAGLONG token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold XAGSHORT tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the XAGSHORT tokens.

#### **BTC/XAU**

In the last year, worldwide markets have experienced a bullish trend which have pushed investors to look for a way to shift their investments into more stable safe-havens. Gold could be used to hedge against stock volatility. This has proven an effective method in the past, but a newer alternative is challenging the old-school safe-haven. Bitcoin has been launched in 2008/2009 and ever since it has represented a leading cryptocurrency, with many of the properties of a currency. It also shares with gold some unique features that could make it a viable haven.

**How to trade?**

* Buy  the BTCXAUL Spread token if you believe borderless decentralized crypto asset projects will be a safer hedge against inflation. Therefore, by buying a BTC/XAUL Long Position token the trader is able to express their view that the future hedge against inflation will be dominated by crypto assets;
* Buy the BTCXAUS Spread token if you believe gold has stood the test of time and can still be considered a better way to hedge inflation risk. The BTCX/AUS Short Position token takes the opposite view that physical stores of value commodities such as gold will dominate.

**Settlement**

You can sell your BTC/XAU Spread tokens to Mettalex's Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold BTCXAUL tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the BTCXAUL token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold BTCXAUS tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the BTCXAUS tokens.

#### **BTC/TSLA**

Bitcoin is gaining a lot of adoption as a store of value. However, Bitcoin mining consumes a lot of electricity and resources that are powered by fossil fuels and non-renewable sources of energy.  Tesla is a clean energy company that is focusing on accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Do you think Bitcoin price will grow faster than Tesla share price in the future or vice versa?

**How to trade?**

* Buy the BTCTSLAL if you believe bitcoin’s price will perform better than Tesla stock in the future; 
* Buy the BCTSLAS if you believe Tesla is undervalued against Bitcoin but its price will increase in the future.

**Settlement**

You can sell your BTC/TSLA Spread tokens to Mettalex's Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold BTCTSLAL tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the BTCTSLAL token \(in red letters\);
* Alternatively, If you hold BTCTSLAS tokens and the floor gets breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the cap gets breached, you will lose the tokens you used to buy the BTCTSLAS tokens.

#### **AAVE/COMP**

Aave is a decentralized money market protocol that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a trustless manner. On the other hand, Compound is a decentralized, blockchain-based protocol that allows users to lend and borrow crypto. Deposit in either lending protocols to earn interest and protocol-specific governance tokens.  If a protocol takes off, the governance tokens become much more valuable than the interest.

**How to trade?**

* Buy the AAVECOMPL if you believe the AAVE protocol to become more dominant in the future in the lending protocols scenario;
* Buy the AAVECOMPS if you believe the COMPOUND protocol to acquire a bigger share of the market, thus acquiring more relevance in the lending protocols space.

**Settlement**

You can sell your AAVE/COMP Spread tokens to Mettalex's Autonomous Market Maker at any time before market settlement. If the oracle-reported price breaches the floor or the cap, this market will be automatically settled:

* If you hold AAVECOMPL tokens and the cap is breached, you will earn the amount displayed when opening the position \(in green letters\). If the floor is breached, you will lose the amount you used to buy the AAVECOMPL token \(in red letters\);
